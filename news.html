                <h3>Elden Ring Nightreign Network Test Announced</h3>
                <img src="img/NEWS/eldenRing.png" alt="Image 1">
                <p>Hot off the heels of its unexpected announcement at this year's Game Awards show, Bandai Namco has confirmed Elden Ring Nightreign will be getting a network playtest, and it's coming sooner than fans may have thought. Select players will be able to sign up for the Elden Ring Nightreign playtest as early as next month, with registration opening in January.</p>
                <p>Released back in 2022, few games seem to be able to stay on top of the video game industry quite like Elden Ring, with the now-revered action RPG making waves at last night's Game Awards. Elden Ring released its highly anticipated DLC expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, this summer. This expansion allowed fans to become even more engrossed in the Lands Between and more, featuring new items to collect, weapons to use, and bosses to slay. However, a lot of fans may have been left wondering what was next for the game, with developers stating an Elden Ring sequel wasn't on the table. Now fans know, with Elden Ring Nightreign officially unveiled.</p>

                <h3>Payday Creator Shows Off New Co-Op Game Den of Wolves</h3>
                <img src="img/NEWS/payday.png" alt="Image 2">
                <p>10 Chambers has revealed some new gameplay footage from Den of Wolves, its upcoming sci-fi heist game. This new look at Den of Wolves was shared during the 2024 edition of The Game Awards.</p>
                <p>10 Chambers is a Stockholm, Sweden-based studio founded by Ulf Andersson, the creator of the first two Payday games. Founded in 2015, the company released its first title six years later, debuting it in the form of co-op horror shooter GTFO. In December 2023, 10 Chambers took to The Game Awards to announce its next project, a sci-fi heist game Den of Wolves. A year later, the developer once again appeared at one of Geoff Keighley's shows, taking to The Game Awards 2024 to share a fresh gameplay trailer for Den of Wolves. The 90-second video serves as an introduction to the game's setting, Midway City, a corporate haven located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The trailer's narrator describes this cyberpunk metropolis as a "land of opportunity" where players will be able to get rich or die trying. Following that brief introduction, the new Den of Wolves trailer erupts into pure chaos, showing an erratic sequence of glimpses at action-packed gameplay involving massive shootouts, environmental destruction, and daring escapes. </p>

                <h3>Overcooked Studio Announces New Co-Op Game Stage Fright</h3>
                <img src="img/NEWS/overcooked.png" alt="Image 2">
                <p>Developer Ghost Town Games announced its new co-op title, Stage Fright, during The Game Awards 2024 on December 12. Ghost Town Games is the studio responsible for Overcooked, a series published by Team17 and beloved for its co-op craziness. Stage Fright is the studio's new two-player cooperative entry, and for now, it has only been announced for PC. No Man's Sky developer, Hello Games, will publish the title.</p>
                <p>Ghost Town Games is an award-winning indie studio made up of just three core members, bringing on collaborators as needed for larger projects. In 2016, the team released Overcooked, quickly cementing its place as one of the best multiplayer experiences in gaming. Following its success, Overcooked 2 launched in 2018, doubling down on the chaos and zaniness with new kitchen settings and challenges. After the remaster, Overcooked! All You Can Eat, fans wondered what the studio was cooking next. The studio announced Stage Fright during The Game Awards 2024 ceremony, promising to deliver a fresh cooperative experience. In this game, players will embark on an adventure packed with obstacles to overcome, environments to explore, and escape rooms to navigate as they unravel an ancient mystery. If Stage Fright's multiplayer is anything like Overcooked's, players had better tread carefully, because the game's cooperative mode could test even the strongest friendships.</p>

                <h3>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth PC Requirements Revealed</h3>
                <img src="img/NEWS/finalF.png" alt="Image 2">
                <p>Square Enix recently revealed the official system requirements for running Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on PC. The PC port of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was announced during The Game Awards on December 12, and the RPG will be available on Steam and the Epic Games Store on January 23, 2025.</p>
                <p>Originally released early in 2024, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second entry in the popular Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy. In it, Cloud and his companions leave the city of Midgar and explore other locales such as Gold Saucer, Cosmo Canyon, and Nibelheim. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth received excellent reviews upon its release, as critics have praised its combat system, charismatic characters, giant open-world zones, and compelling side content. Now that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth has been confirmed for PC, Square Enix has revealed the gameâ€™s system requirements, which are quite hefty. To run the game with any settings, 16 GB of RAM will be required, as well as plenty of space, as the game requires an SSD with 155 GB to spare. When talking about CPUs, running it on Low at 30 FPS and 1080p requires only an AMD Ryzen 5 1400 or an Intel Core i3 8100. However, achieving 60 FPS at 2160p will require an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X or an Intel Core i7 10700, which is in line with major recent releases. The necessary GPUs include AMD RX 6600, Intel A580, or Nvidia RTX 2060 for Low settings, AMD RX 6700 XT or Nvidia RTX 2070 for Medium, or AMD RX 7900 XTX and Nvidia RTX 4080 for High. Additionally, gamers need to use Windows 10 or 11 to run Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p>

                <h3>The First Berserker: Khazan Release Date and Demo Plans</h3>
                <img src="img/NEWS/berserk.png" alt="Image 2">
                <p>The First Berserker: Khazan, a new action RPG from the Korean developer Neople, will be released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 27, 2025. Those interested in trying out the hardcore gameplay found in The First Berserker: Khazan won't have to wait that long, however, as a demo will be available on January 16, 2025. First revealed in December 2023, The First Berserker: Khazan is a single-player title set in the same universe as Dungeon Fighter Online, a multiplayer beat 'em up title first released in Korea in 2005 and ported globally in 2015. Incredibly, Dungeon Fighter Online remains one of the highest-grossing games of all time, earning over $22 billion in revenue by June 2023. The First Berserker: Khazan promises to be darker than its inspiration, featuring gruesome, fast-paced combat with a distinctive anime style. The first 15 minutes of the game was shown during Gamescom in August, though a concrete release date remained a mystery. Finally, those eager to get their hands on the title have answers.</p>
                <p>During The Game Awards 2024, it was announced that The First Berserker: Khazan will be released on March 27, 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. Additionally, Neople and publisher Nexon revealed that a demo would be coming to all platforms on January 16, transporting players into the role of "the ancestor of all Slayers." All saved data in the demo can be transferred to the full game. Curious players were able to see fresh footage of the title in a new trailer, highlighting the inspiration Khazan seems to take from the Berserk manga series and FromSoftware's Souls games. The newest trailer for The First Berserker: Khazan is backed by some serious star power, as the Russo Brothers, known for their work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, supervised fans' latest glimpse into the RPG. More information regarding pre-order bonuses for the challenging semi-Soulslike has also been revealed. Those purchasing the Standard Edition, either digitally or physically, will get the "Fallen Star" Armor Set alongside the base game. The digital-only Deluxe Edition will include the base game, the aforementioned "Fallen Star" Armor Set, the "Hero" Armor and Weapon Sets, a digital artbook, the game's soundtrack, and 72-hour early access to the game.</p>
